Module 4 Challenge
# Background
Pandas Challenge 1 is a module challenge focused on data analysis using Python's Pandas library. This challenge provides an opportunity to develop practical skills in exploring, cleaning, processing, and analyzing large datasets. By working through this challenge, I gained experience in addressing real-world business questions using data.
# Challenge Instructions
Part 1: Explore the Data:
In this part, I imported the data, viewed column names, used the describe function to gather basic statistics, and answered specific questions using Pandas.

Part 2: Transform the Data:
Now that I have a better understanding of the data, I transformed it for better analysis. Tasks included creating columns for subtotal, shipping price, total price, cost, and profit for each line.

Part 3: Confirm Your Work:
After transforming the data, I confirmed my calculations by comparing them with email receipts showing total prices for three orders.

Part 4: Summarize and Analyze:
I used the transformed data to find information such as total revenue from top clients. Then created a summary DataFrame, formatted the data for presentation, and wrote a brief summary of my findings.
